Multiple trials at each value of T_A should be run using the files in the simulations folder. We run 300 trials.
Each simulation will output a certain number of snapshots (20 in our work).
Each snapshot can be pre-processed into the input for machine learning with the script Preprocess_data_one_TA.py.
The preprocessed data at each TA is expected to be concatenated for all trials and form a large input numpy array. In our case
this array has a leading size of 20 x 300 = 6000.  The code for this concatenation is not provided. The resulting numpy arrays after concatenation should be saved 
as X_TA_$TA.npy (the distances and angles) and  Y_TA_$TA.npy (the rates of work), where $TA is a variable that assumes the values of T_A for which the machine learning is to be done.
Once these files are done, the script Cont_conv_train_plot_results.ipynb can be run to train the network and plot results.
