Add the atom.cpp, atom.h, fix_bd_AOUP.cpp, fix_bd_AOUP.h to the lammps src folder, and compile lammps as a library (ie "make mpi mode=lib")
Copy Lammps_drivensystem_run.cpp, AOUP_input.in and Makefile to a folder where you want to run the simulations, and type "make" to compile the cpp file. 
Run simulation as "./Lammps_drivensystem_run.out 1 AOUP_input.in Pe Pe tau gamma"

May need to copy liblammps.a into the same folder as above.
